DSI->Defect Severity Index (open)


Let's assume that every severity we have certain index defined


Critical------->5
High------------>3
Medium----------->2
Low-------------->1



Number of Bugs identified per severity

# Critical Bugs ---------->2
# High Bugs -------------> 4
# Medium Bugs------------>6
# Low Bugs-------------->0


DSI = ((2*5) + (4*3) + (6*2) + (0*1))/12 ==  34/12 = 2.83

Test Strategy

If DSI > 1 and no critical bug open------> No release  
If DSI <=1 ------>Release



In test plan if have defined-->no critical
